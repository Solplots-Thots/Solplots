# Plotting & Thotting ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Everything is a plot derived from a thot 

# Race and Income in DC ---------------------------------------------------

# Data Source: U.S. Census

# The U.S. Census is arguable the most famous data set that exists
# regarding the "state" of the United States. 

# The etymology of the word "statistics", according to Merriam Webster,
# is thus:

# German "Statistik" study of political facts and figures, 
# from New Latin "statisticus" of politics, 
# from Latin "status" state

# Let's agree to a consensus on the state of the state

# Let's plot & thot

# Packages ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr)

# As usual, we'll be working in the tidyverse (mainly ggplot2 and dplyr,
# grammars for plotting (data visualization) and data wrangling, respectively)

# Simple Features (sf)

# This is the very first Plotting & Thotting in which learn how to create
# a map using R

# However, we only need one function, sf::geom_sf(), which is a "geom"
# that is used within the ggplot framework

# This forum will not cover geo-computation or cartography, but rather
# this is a nice exercise in quickly putting something together
# with Census data

# Tidycensus (tidycensus)

# Kyle Walker is the author of tidycensus (from his website):

# tidycensus is an R package that allows users to interface 
# with a select number of the US Census Bureauâ€™s data APIs and 
# return tidyverse-ready data frames, optionally with simple feature 
# geometry included

# tidycensus is designed to help R users get Census data that is 
# pre-prepared for exploration within the tidyverse, and optionally 
# spatially with sf

# For suggested resources that go into further detail, please refer
# to the slide deck presentation 

# Getting started ---------------------------------------------------------

# The U.S. Census makes you submit your email account in order to receive
# an API key.

# You need an API key from the Census in order for this script

# To download the data we need (median household income at the tract
# level of White, Black, Asian and Hispanic residents of DC) we will
# use `get_acs()`

# Ok so we know that nobody lives on the National Mall (which is its own
# census tract), so if we included that row in our map, it'll be filled 
# in just like the others

# I took the creative liberty to decide to remove all tracts where the 
# value of median household income is 0
